Classification is enforced through correct path and filename, such that an artifact’s location alone reveals its classification, status, and provenance. Classification operates against a closed, authoritative taxonomy and is not interpretive or discretionary. The role owns intake, naming, placement, and lifecycle rules; oversees normalization of legacy and in-flight materials; and authors and governs standard operating procedures (SOPs) that keep the structure and overall estate environment correct, auditable, and durable—rendering appropriate interaction obvious and retrieval reliable without reliance on personal memory. Progress is defined by irreversible reduction in ambiguity, duplication, and misclassification, not by throughput or activity volume. The role works day-to-day within the Estate Manager’s guidance and operational orchestration, memorializing and classifying estate activity into the authoritative record. Both roles serve the estate principal: the Estate Manager professionalizes leadership through real-world operational execution, while the Library Scientist holds architectural authority over the file system, classification structure, and SOP governance, ensuring durability, auditability, and reliable retrieval over time. Why This Is Unusual Few roles grant a library scientist real authority to shape the file system itself as an operational substrate rather than a passive repository. If you believe the file system is the library, and that SOPs exist to keep the estate environment functionally correct over time, this role will feel rigorous, practical, and deeply satisfying.
